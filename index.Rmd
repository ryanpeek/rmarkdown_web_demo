## Building a RMarkdown Website

This is just a demo for how to build an RMarkdown website. the main files you'll need are:

 - `.nojekyll` (this tells github how to build page)
 - `_site.yml` (this is the outline/design of the site)
 - `header.html` (*optional*: provides some extra formats/design options for header, footer, etc.)
 - `style.css` (*optional*: provides instructions on how you want website to look)
 - `[webpages].Rmd`: These are your webpage content files...one Rmd per webpage, named the same as the links in your `_site.yml`
